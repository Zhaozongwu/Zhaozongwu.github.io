* Video Interpolation 
 * Dec.2019 - present
 * Tianjin,China
 * Organized by teacher Ke Chen.
 *  I use adobe240fps as the dataset and select U-Net as CNN layers,then do linear combinations and get a high frame rate video(Given two consecutive frames,Generate the middle frame) at last.At present,I’m trying to understand the algorithm and research the better method.

* Cifar-100 is used for image classiﬁcation
 * Jul.2019 - Aug.2019 
 * Tianjin,China
 * Organized by Prof.Jianming Wang. 
 * We use pytorch to build deep convolution neural network and the convolutional neural network model is realized by Python programming. The training of the image dataset cifar-10 and cifar-100 was used to train the model, and the eﬀectiveness of the model was veriﬁed by classiﬁcation in the test set.we use RseNet model to get 94 accuracy.

* Reinforcement learning:Robot maze
 * Jul.2019 - Aug.2019 
 * Organized by teacher Zuowei Wang. 
 * I Build a gym environment for robots to walk the maze and use Qlearning method to realize robot maze(Given initial state and make use of Greedy strategy,get reward value and get next step action).what’s more ,I made a graph of whether the robot will come out of the maze.

* Generation of vocabulary in English textbooks 
 * Jul.2018 - Jul.2019 
 * Organized by teacher ke Chen. 
 * I use python to Read English text and spilt some word grop.Then I use sort algorithm to sort it and get words in alphabetical order.I mster some python syntax which is more conventient.It has laid a solid foundation for my future projects.
