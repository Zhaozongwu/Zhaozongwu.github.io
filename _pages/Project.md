* Video Interpolation 
 * Dec.2019 - present
 * Tianjin,China
 * Organized by teacher Ke Chen.
 *  I use adobe240fps as the dataset and select U-Net as CNN layers, then do linear combinations and get a high frame rate video(Given two consecutive frames, Generate the middle frame) at last. At present, I’m trying to understand the algorithm and research the better method.

* Cifar-100 is used for image classiﬁcation
 * Jul.2019 - Aug.2019 
 * Tianjin,China
 * Organized by Prof.Jianming Wang. 
 * We used pytorch framework to build the ResNet model and did the classification experiment on cifar-10 and cifar-100 respectively.Then we observed the accuracy of the test set , modify the model and achieved 94% accuracy at last.
* Reinforcement learning:Robot maze
 * Jul.2019 - Aug.2019 
 * Organized by teacher Zuowei Wang. 
 * I Builded a gym environment for robots to walk the maze and used Qlearning method to realize robot maze(Given initial state and make use of Greedy strategy, get reward value and get next step action). Also I made a graph of whether the robot will come out of the maze.

* Generation of vocabulary in English textbooks 
 * Jul.2018 - Jul.2019 
 * Organized by teacher ke Chen. 
 * I used python syntax to Read English text and spilted some word grop.Then I used sort algorithm to sort it and got words in alphabetical order.I mstered some python syntax and Improved my programming skills.
